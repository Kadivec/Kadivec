# Hello there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px">

🎓 I am Tapajyoti Bose, a **Front End Web Developer** (specializing in **React Applications**) and a **Top Rated** [**Freelancer**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c12e516ee1d35044) on _Upwork_. I am also Pursuing my Bachelor in **Computer Science & Engineering** and will graduate in mid-2022.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have contributed to several Gigantic Organizations including, **Material UI**, **Microsoft**, **Amazon**, **Webhint**, and countless others. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021, I learned **Next.js**, **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, **GraphQL**, **Micro-Frontend Architecture** and **Blockchain development & DApps**. I got started with [**Freelancing**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c12e516ee1d35044) and [**Blogging**](https://dev.to/ruppysuppy) quite recently and made a name for myself.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **guitar**, **break dancing (hip-hop)**, **sketching**, and **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand**.

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **The Compound Effect** by _Darren Hardy_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love **traveling** too. I have been on solo trips to **Bhutan** in _2018_ and to **Hyderabad, India** in _2021_.
