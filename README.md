# Hello there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px">

🎓 I am Andraž Kadivec, a Computer Engineer from Slovenia 🇸🇮. I am also pursuing my Bachelor in Information Security and will graduate in mid-2024.

👨‍💻 I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology.

 Outside the world of tech, I enjoy building models from Lego bricks.

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **The Compound Effect** by _Darren Hardy_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love **traveling** too. I have been on solo trips to **Bhutan** in _2018_ and to **Hyderabad, India** in _2021_.
