🎓 I am Andraž Kadivec, a Computer Engineer from Slovenia . I am also pursuing my Bachelor in Information Security and will graduate in mid-2024.

👨‍💻 I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. Outside the world of tech, I enjoy building models from Lego bricks.

✈️ I love **traveling** too. I have been on trips to **Mauritius** in and to **Wisconsin** in _2015_.
